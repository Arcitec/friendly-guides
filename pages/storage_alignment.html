            "description": "Enter your disk's <em>real</em> (physical) sector size here (usually 4096 or higher). <em>Don't</em> enter its logical or emulated size (which is usually 512).<br /><br />You can check what physical sector size your drive is reporting to the operating system, by running the command <code>cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/physical_block_size</code> (replace <b>nvme0n1</b> with your device name).<br /><br />Alternatively, you can try the command <code>lsblk -o NAME,PHY-SEC</code> to list all devices and their physical sector sizes.<br /><br />You should also try <code>sudo hdparm -I /dev/nvme0n1 | grep Physical</code> (use your own disk name), which requests identification info directly from the drive via an ATA command and may give the true answer if the previous commands didn't. However, many drives don't respond to that command.<br /><br />Almost all consumer-grade SSDs \"lie\" and pretend to use 512 byte sectors for backwards compatibility reasons, which is known as \"<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Format\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Format 512e</a>\" and means that the disk is emulating 512 byte sectors, but actually uses a larger size internally. This is mainly done because <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/backup-and-storage/support-policy-4k-sector-hard-drives\" target=\"_blank\">Windows 7 and earlier</a> doesn't support large sector sizes.<br /><br />The majority of SSDs actually use 4K or larger sectors physically. 4K is the most common, but 8K and 16K are also common sizes, particularly for very large drives, to make the physical page count manageable for the SSD's controller.<br /><br />Note that it's completely okay if your drive pretends to use 512 byte sectors, since it just means that the Linux kernel will receive/pre-fetch all the other \"logical sectors\" of the real \"physical sector\" whenever it asks the drive to give it a specific sector. For example, if your SSD uses 4096 byte sectors but pretends to use 512, your Linux kernel will simply receive 8x512 byte sectors (a whole physical sector) every time it asks the drive for one 512 byte sector. And the kernel will cache those subsequent sectors for a while, so that it can provide an instant response in case a program wanted to read the other sectors too.<br /><br />Likewise, when you write data to a disk that is performing \"512e\" emulation, the drive itself knows that it should cache the incoming data and arrange it into coherent sectors on disk, which means that if you're writing a larger data structure (such as a 4096 byte filesystem block), the SSD will wait a while for the other \"emulated\" 512 byte chunks and collect them into a single 4096 byte or larger write. Therefore it doesn't have to invoke any read-modify-write process on a \"partial physical sector\", since all modern SSDs cache incoming data (usually in onboard RAM) and therefore naturally waits for the other emulated 512 byte sectors before it overwrites the whole physical sector.<br /><br />Due to the SSD's write cache, and the operating system's read cache, you <a href=\"http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/4kn-vs-512e-ssd-sector-size-in-terms-of-performance.835440/\" target=\"_blank\">will not see any performance difference</a> between a 512 byte emulated or a native 4096+ byte sector SSD unless your SSD is capable of massive PCIe 4.0 or higher SSD speeds. The only noticeable difference is that CPU usage for file transfers will be lower with large/native sectors, but unless you're constantly transferring massive amounts of data at high speeds, that really won't matter either. Just think about the fact that the emulation is fast enough that all consumer-grade vendors ship their SSDs in \"512e\" mode by default.<br /><br />However, it's still important that you research the <em>true</em> sector size for partition/LUKS/LVM/filesystem alignment purposes, so that all reads/writes will be aligned to the real, physical sectors!<br /><br />Lastly, note that some SSDs (such as <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006392/memory-and-storage.html\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a>'s data center drives and <a href=\"https://www.sabrent.com/acronis/ssc/\" target=\"_blank\">Sabrent</a> NVMe drives) have released tools that let you change the physical sector size manually. And even if your vendor hasn't released a tool, you can often use the generic <code>hdparm --set-sector-size</code> tool (which sends the standardized ATA <code>SET SECTOR CONFIGURATION</code> command) to tell the drive to reconfigure itself, but a vendor tool is preferable if one exists, since it may perform some extra steps. Be careful if you decide to reconfigure your physical sector size, because that process will <em>destroy</em> all existing data on your disk since all existing filesystem block references will become invalid/scrambled, and the SSD will most likely reset its own sector mapping table too! If you aren't using a PCIe 4.0 or faster SSD, there's no good reason to change your sector size.",

Your read/write performance is greatly improved if you set LUKS to 4096 byte sectors (the largest size LUKS supports), since this reduces the amount of internal kernel interrupts and block-queue overhead in LUKS compared to its default 512 byte sectors, and gets 8x more work done per instruction/call to hardware accelerators such as AES-NI.<br /><br />Also note that there is no reason to use the smaller sizes even if you have a disk with small physical sectors (such as 512), because modern file systems all use (and recommend) 4096 byte data blocks by default, so anything you write on your filesystems on top of LUKS will always cause 8x512 physical sectors to be written, so even with an old disk you may as well run LUKS in 4096 byte mode too, for enhanced performance.<br /><br />Interestingly, LUKS devices always present themselves to the system as having a physical and logical sector size equal to the block size you configured LUKS with.

That's why all of the major, modern filesystems use 4096 as their recommended block size (even on disks with small sectors).<br /><br />Note that Ext4 only supports 1K/2K/4K block sizes. This is because Linux requires blocksize &lt;= PAGE_SIZE (which is 4 KiB on x86), so basically all filesystems use blocksize &lt;= 4096 unless they implement support internally for reading/writing partial disk blocks from the page or buffer cache. Therefore, 4K block size is the highest performance and most recommended option for normal files, regardless of what filesystem you use. Even if a filesystem could go higher than that, you won't gain any more performance, since 4K is the sweetspot of performance and disk utilization.<br /><br />Also note that the Ext4 filesystem uses a feature called \"extents\" to efficiently handle metadata for large files by only storing the start block and block count of each contiguous section of a file, rather than listing every individual block. So there's no real benefit to larger block sizes even if Ext4 had been capable of that, and it would just lead to wasted disk space.<br /><br />Lastly, you may have heard the myth that it's \"best to align the filesystem's data inside the SSD's physical erase blocks\" via features such as \"filesystem stride/stripe parameters\", to reduce write amplification. <a href=\"https://superuser.com/a/1635137/1102844\" target=\"_blank\">That is utter nonsense</a>. Modern SSDs since around 2010 use a virtual sector mapping table together with wear leveling, garbage collection and TRIM, which means that individual sectors are spread across the disk and continuously moved. There's absolutely no way to force a modern SSD to place filesystem data sequentially within physical erase blocks, so don't even try. Just ignore any guide that makes such outdated claims. The only things that matters for health on modern SSDs is that you align all data to physical sectors and enable TRIM, since the SSD requires knowledge about dead/useless sectors (via TRIM) for proper garbage collection, performance, and a long and healthy life.",
